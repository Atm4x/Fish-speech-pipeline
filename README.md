# **Fish-Speech-Lib** 0.1.0

Original project: [Fish-Speech](https://github.com/fishaudio/fish-speech)
<hr/>

***Fish-Speech-Lib*** is a Python library that provides a simple interface to the Fish-Speech pipeline, allowing you to generate high-quality speech with voice cloning capabilities without requiring a web UI.

Pytorch with CUDA or MPS is required to get Fish-Speech-Lib working.

**It may contain bugs. Report an issue in case of error.**

## Prerequisites

You must have **Python>=3.10** installed.

You must have **CUDA or MPS** support for your GPU (MPS is not fully tested yet).

## **Installation**
1) Install pytorch **with CUDA or MPS support** here: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

2) Then, install Fish-Speech-Lib using pip install:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/Atm4x/Fish-speech-pipeline#egg=fish_speech_lib
```

3) Finally, create a `.project-root` file in the root directory of your project.

## Usage

Fish-Speech-Lib provides a class called `FishSpeech`. There are a few parameters that are optional:

`device` - Device to run on: "cuda" (default), "cpu", or "mps"

`half` - Whether to use half-precision (FP16) (default is False)

`compile_model` - Whether to use torch.compile for optimization (Not tested, needs to have CUDA toolkit installed)(default is False)

`llama_checkpoint_path` - Path to LLaMA model (default is "checkpoints/fish-speech-1.5")

`decoder_checkpoint_path` - Path to decoder model (default is "checkpoints/fish-speech-1.5/firefly-gan-vq-fsq-8x1024-21hz-generator.pth")

`streaming` - Enable streaming mode (DOESN'T WORK RN) (default is False)

To use the model, first make an instance of FishSpeech:

```python
from fish_speech_lib.inference import FishSpeech
import soundfile as sf

# Initialize model
tts = FishSpeech(
    device="cuda",
    half=False,
    compile_model=False
)
```

And the final step is calling the model to generate speech:

```python 
sample_rate, audio_data = tts(text="Hello, world!", max_new_tokens=450)
sf.write("output.wav", audio_data, sample_rate, format='WAV')
```

Parameters for the `tts()` function:

`text` - Text to be synthesized (required)

`reference_audio` - Path to reference audio for voice cloning (optional, default is None)

`reference_audio_text` - Text spoken in the reference audio (optional, default is "")

`top_p` - Top-p sampling parameter (optional, default is 0.7)

`temperature` - Temperature for sampling (optional, default is 0.7)

`repetition_penalty` - Repetition penalty (optional, default is 1.2)

`max_new_tokens` - Maximum number of tokens to generate (optional, default is 1024)

`chunk_length` - Length of iterative prompt in words (optional, default is 200)

`seed` - Random seed for reproducibility (optional, default is None)

`use_memory_cache` - Use memory cache for reference audio (optional, default is True)

## Example of usage
A simple example for generating speech:

```python
from fish_speech_lib.inference import FishSpeech
import soundfile as sf

# Initialize model
tts = FishSpeech(device="cuda")

# Generate speech
sample_rate, audio_data = tts(text="Hello, world!", max_new_tokens=450)

# Save the audio
sf.write("output.wav", audio_data, sample_rate, format='WAV')
```

## Voice Cloning Example

```python
# Generate speech with voice cloning
sample_rate, audio_data = tts(
    "This is an example of voice cloning with Fish-Speech.",
    reference_audio="path/to/reference.wav",
    reference_audio_text="The text that is spoken in the reference audio.",
    max_new_tokens=1000,
    chunk_length=1000
)

sf.write("cloned_voice.wav", audio_data, sample_rate, format='WAV')
```

## Model Downloading

The library automatically downloads the required models from the Hugging Face Hub if they are not found locally. The models are downloaded to the specified checkpoint paths.

## Exceptions

No exceptions found rn, but if you encounter any, please report them.
